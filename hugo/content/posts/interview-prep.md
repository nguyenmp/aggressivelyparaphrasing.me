I decided to start looking for a job and decided to document my process.  Part of the motivation is to organize my own work.  Another is to help critically think about the process and decisions through writing.

## Primers

These are short but valuable write ups about interviewing in tech.

I think I need to focus on training people.  For a long time, I focused my resume on projects and technical success, not on people and process.

I think overall, I like how they break down senior engineer interviews, but the actual actionable data is pretty lacking.  How doesn’t one improve on systems questions and experience interviews?  The only real suggestion is read Elements or Programming Interview.

Skills aren’t binary.  This article suggests they’re trinary.

Big take away is multiple offers is best, and a good alternative is to be employed.

### Peak

Talks about how the best way to improve is to just do things for a very long amount of time, but also that the doing must be deliberate practice, it must be work just outside your comfort zone.  Otherwise, you just stagnate at your level.

When I think of those ideas of deliberate practice, I think about the following sections, that I’ve practiced algorithms significantly over the last five to six years, but have very little practice and experience around system design questions and experience questions.  It’s also clear those are required to getting to the next level.  As such, I’ll spend most of my time on the latter, since that’s where I need the most growth.

## Algorithms

For the most part, I feel like I have the basics down and there’s established systems of studying for this type of interview.  In particular, I feel like this category is much like the SAT, where you can learn how to answer these types of questions, rather than any particular innate talent.  Moreover, like the SAT, practice really does significantly improve performance.

### LeetCode

Honestly, I much prefer LeetCode over HackerRank, if purely for the ergonomics of answering questions.  HackerRank deals with standard input and standard output, whereas LeetCode is mostly called functions, acting much more like unit-tests so you real with the meat of the algorithm instead of the ceremony of parsing and printing.

### Cracking the Coding Interview

I read this once in college before landing my first job.  I think it’s an okay introduction but lacks hard questions.  I intend to reread it with the latest edition.

### Elements of Programming Interview

This book is often recommended but I’ve never read it.

## System Design

This is kind of the “next level” technical interview question.  Im rather disappointed by the lack of prep material available in this space, mostly because actual experience for these things can be hard to come by.  In particular, I don’t work on high scale systems very much, though I do understand them and manage a few low scale systems myself.  Because of this, I feel like I need to learn significantly more.

### Pramp

The page itself has a helpful step by step guide to approach system design questions.

Additionally, there is a lot of content on that page near the end.

### Grokking the System Design Interview

It’s $80, but that’s a small price to pay for my future.  I just balance the cost against the potential future benefits of salaries, career growth, and happiness.

### Recommendations from Stepan

> For example, if you don’t know how to scale, you can search “{Company Name} InfoQ” and find some awesome talks. If you’re unsure about concurrency, the book 7 concurrency models in 7 weeks can ramp you up. Don’t know much about databases? 7 databases in 7 weeks.

### Anatomy of a System Design Interview

They have yet another breakdown, but also more study material to go through.

## Experience, Leadership, Soft Skills

I kind of group up all the soft skills and leadership skills together under “experience”.  I think project management can also fit under here.  Part of the reason is because, in an interview, all of these requirements are checked off together.  People ask about your history leading projects, dealing with conflict, missing deadlines, all to probe at these non-technical skills.  I felt like I was lacking here so I decided to read A LOT about it.  It’s also rather fortunate that there’s a significant amount written on these topics.

### Pragmatic Programmer
### Culture Code: The Secrets of Highly Successful Groups
### The Mythical Man-Month
### Soft Skills: The Software Developers Life Manual
### Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams
### The Manager’s Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change

I originally got this tech management book half a year before I started my job search.  I felt my ability to connect and communicate with my leadership had gotten rusty and I wanted to learn what it was like from their point of view.

My biggest take-aways are:

* one-on-ones are incredibly important, always maintain an open channel of communication
* rants and venting sessions are fun but not productive
* I need to recap the team lead content
* managers and leaders are not mind readers
* publicly praise, privately criticize

## Negotiation



### Getting to Yes

### Never Split the Difference

> Patio11’s [Salary Negotiation](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/) and Rands’ [The Business](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-business/) are great reading too.
