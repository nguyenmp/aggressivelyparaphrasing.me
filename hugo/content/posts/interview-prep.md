I decided to start looking for a job and decided to document my process.  Part of the motivation is to organize my own work.  Another is to help critically think about the process and decisions through writing.

### 10 Offers, 100 Days. The Journey by Stepan Parunashvili

The [blog post](https://m.stopa.io/10-offers-100-days-the-journey-16a0407b8d95) goes over this individual’s adventure of being highly successful at winning offers at some pretty competitive companies,

There are a few high level points that are pretty valuable:

* Communication with your support group is pretty interesting, some have been pursuing my goals for longer than I have
* At some point, the interview is less focused on algorithms and more on high level systems and project design and soft skills.  Higher level positions are about leading people and projects.  Often, questions about failures, conflicts, failures, deadlines, and weaknesses are to point out and expose experiences dealing with these types of responsibilities.
* Leadership usually entails bringing people up to speed, so it might be worth emphasizing on my resume.  Previously, it was mostly technical focus and project focus, rather than people focused.
* They recommend reading Elements of Programming Interview
* I should formalize my reasons for searching for a new job.  A strong, positive motivation can help establish “strong-fits” for people to recommend you to, and make you more desirable for those companies.
* It may be valuable to “figure out my level” and also to figure out the compensation ranges for that level, using [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi)
* There is a structure to system design questions.  This is repeated in a lot of other blogs.

Below are some quotes I pulled out for reference and to reflect upon.

> Sit down and reflect: What got you here? What did you love about your last job? What would the most amazing opportunity look like?

 I need to do this.

> A week or so after you’re into the book, schedule practice interviews. My favorites are https://interviewing.io and https://pramp.com.

Might be worth trying since they can do system design interviews.

> For System Design, I also suggest three steps. First, master the structure — scope down, go broad, outline a complete solution, go deep on as many components as you can, then go the extra mile, to share how you would actually launch the system. The “System Design” module in the course does a great job of going deep on this. Next, as you go through the practice interviews, you’ll start to notice places where you can improve. Start noting those down and build a plan to learn. For example, if you don’t know how to scale, you can search “{Company Name} InfoQ” and find some awesome talks. If you’re unsure about concurrency, the book 7 concurrency models in 7 weeks can ramp you up. Don’t know much about databases? 7 databases in 7 weeks.

I fear the system design section.  I don’t have much practice in this compared to LeetCode for algorithms and data structures.

> The purpose of the Experience Interview is to understand your scope — the kinds of problems you can solve — and whether you are a culture fit. This interview type largely takes care of itself if you’ve centered on your narrative (you know what you want and where you’re going), and your communication (you know what level you are). The first coneys your culture fit, and the second your scope. You can go deeper on this in the “Experience Interview” module in the course.

I also don’t have much practice answering questions involving soft skills and experience.  I need to figure out these solutions.

> Communicate your level and your narrative. Keep signal and scope top of mind, and communicate clearly during every phase — recruiter screens, technical screens, and and onsites. We go deeper on this in the “Interview Phases” module of the course.

I actually think I don’t do this at all right now.  Part of it was I’ve never really know what I want to do because I’m so open to many options and I like just exploring and trying new things.  When people ask me to tell them what I want, I find it incredibly difficult to express.  However, I also do a pretty bad job expressing what I currently do already.

I think overall, I like how they break down senior engineer interviews, but the actual actionable data is pretty lacking for the two sections I care about the most.  How does one improve on systems questions and experience interviews?  The only real suggestion is read Elements or Programming Interviews, which I’ve seen recommended a lot over the years, but that’s focused on algorithms and data structures.  It does suggest that the real content is in [jobsearch.dev](https://jobsearch.dev/) which is free so maybe I’ll try it.

Skills aren’t binary.  This article suggests they’re trinary.

### How I negotiated a $300,000 job offer in Silicon Valley

[This blog post](https://blog.usejournal.com/how-i-negotiated-a-software-engineer-offer-in-silicon-valley-f11590f5c656) is actually a sequel to one titled [“I interviewed at six top companies in Silicon Valley in six days, and stumbled into six job offers”](https://blog.usejournal.com/i-interviewed-at-six-top-companies-in-silicon-valley-in-six-days-and-stumbled-into-six-job-offers-fe9cc7bbc996).

Big take away is multiple offers is best, and a good alternative is to be employed.

### Peak

Talks about how the best way to improve is to just do things for a very long amount of time, but also that the doing must be deliberate practice, it must be work just outside your comfort zone.  Otherwise, you just stagnate at your level.

When I think of those ideas of deliberate practice, I think about the following sections, that I’ve practiced algorithms significantly over the last five to six years, but have very little practice and experience around system design questions and experience questions.  It’s also clear those are required to getting to the next level.  As such, I’ll spend most of my time on the latter, since that’s where I need the most growth.

## Algorithms

For the most part, I feel like I have the basics down and there’s established systems of studying for this type of interview.  In particular, I feel like this category is much like the SAT, where you can learn how to answer these types of questions, rather than any particular innate talent.  Moreover, like the SAT, practice really does significantly improve performance.

### LeetCode

Honestly, I much prefer LeetCode over HackerRank, if purely for the ergonomics of answering questions.  HackerRank deals with standard input and standard output, whereas LeetCode is mostly called functions, acting much more like unit-tests so you real with the meat of the algorithm instead of the ceremony of parsing and printing.

### Cracking the Coding Interview

I read this once in college before landing my first job.  I think it’s an okay introduction but lacks hard questions.  I intend to reread it with the latest edition.

### Elements of Programming Interview

This book is often recommended but I’ve never read it.

## System Design

This is kind of the “next level” technical interview question.  Im rather disappointed by the lack of prep material available in this space, mostly because actual experience for these things can be hard to come by.  In particular, I don’t work on high scale systems very much, though I do understand them and manage a few low scale systems myself.  Because of this, I feel like I need to learn significantly more.

### Pramp

https://blog.pramp.com/how-to-succeed-in-a-system-design-interview-27b35de0df26

The page itself has a helpful step by step guide to approach system design questions.

Additionally, there is a lot of content on that page near the end.

### Grokking the System Design Interview

It’s $80, but that’s a small price to pay for my future.  I just balance the cost against the potential future benefits of salaries, career growth, and happiness.

### Recommendations from Stepan

### Anatomy of a System Design Interview

https://hackernoon.com/anatomy-of-a-system-design-interview-4cb57d75a53f

They have yet another breakdown, but also more study material to go through.

## Experience, Leadership, Soft Skills

I kind of group up all the soft skills and leadership skills together under “experience”.  I think project management can also fit under here.  Part of the reason is because, in an interview, all of these requirements are checked off together.  People ask about your history leading projects, dealing with conflict, missing deadlines, all to probe at these non-technical skills.  I felt like I was lacking here so I decided to read A LOT about it.  It’s also rather fortunate that there’s a significant amount written on these topics.

### Pragmatic Programmer
### Culture Code: The Secrets of Highly Successful Groups
### The Mythical Man-Month
### Soft Skills: The Software Developers Life Manual
### Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams
### The Manager’s Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change

I originally got this tech management book half a year before I started my job search.  I felt my ability to connect and communicate with my leadership had gotten rusty and I wanted to learn what it was like from their point of view.

My biggest take-aways are:

* one-on-ones are incredibly important, always maintain an open channel of communication
* rants and venting sessions are fun but not productive
* I need to recap the team lead content
* managers and leaders are not mind readers
* publicly praise, privately criticize

## Negotiation



### Getting to Yes

### Never Split the Difference

> Patio11’s [Salary Negotiation](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/) and Rands’ [The Business](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-business/) are great reading too.

## Practicing

There should have been practicing this whole time during preparation, but there’s something special about going through a series of full end-to-end interviews.  Specifically, having another person question you and give you feedback.  Thus, this section is dedicated towards getting real feedback.
