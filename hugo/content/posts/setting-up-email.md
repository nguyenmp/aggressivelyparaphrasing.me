I had a lot of trouble setting up my new email.  I managed to snag a new domain name and signed up for MXRoute as my server.  I added three DNS Records: one primary MX, one secondary MX, and a TXT record.  I was able to send email from my mail server immediately.  I was able to receive direct email, but catch-all is not working.
