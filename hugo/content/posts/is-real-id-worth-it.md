Today, I processed my California real ID and it will arrive in the mail in 3 to 5 weeks.  It ended up taking 60 minutes in and out, with a 15 minute commute in each direction, plus $28 dollars, and about 20 minutes finding and printing documents.  All-in-all, I kind of wondered if it was worth the time, effort, and money.  To answer this question, I’m going to list out some common arguments for getting them and try to objectively measure the costs associated.

The alternative is to use your passport.  I wouldn’t want to carry it around either, but there’s also the passport card, which costs $38 dollars.
