Today I wanted to talk about some fun adventures around homonyms in Japanese.  My friend invited me to a restaurant called Sumika.  While searching up this restaurant, I noticed that there was a Japanese band also called Sumika.

Sumika the restaurant is written with 炭家, where the first character is pronounced "sumi" and means charcoal, and the second character is pronounced "ka" and means home or expert.

Sumika the band is written with romanji, or roman letters.  That is derived from すみか which could probably be written as 住家.  The first character means "live" and can be pronounced "su" or "sumi".  The second character means "house".  Together, they mean "residence".

Japanese often has a lot of homonyms because each "character" can be read multiple ways upon multiple ways.  There are only about 100 syllables available.  Each character usually is one or two syllables.  A character usually has both a Chinese pronunciation and a Japanese pronunciation, which doesn't really mean much because Japanese uses both pronunciations.  It's more about where the pronunciation was originally derived from.  Japanese words that are unique to Japanese, meaning it wasn't borrowed from China a long long time ago may only have a Japanese pronuniciation.  Even then, there are often multiple ways even in one origin.  An example is 家, where with only the Japanese pronunciation, it can be pronounced "uchi" or "ie".  They all means home and can be used somewhat interchangably, especially conversationally.

I think the homonyms make Japanese fun and difficult.

As an aside, I also was suprised when I listened to the band's [top listed video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFITBgsyVr4 "sumika / Lovers【Music Video】") on YouTube.  I thought the music and the band members felt really familiar.  I knew it came from an anime where the intro had characters doing some fun choreography.  After searching Crunchyroll for a while, I finally just searched for "sumika anime" and found [the intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObQd7Co7Q_I "『Lyrics AMV』Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii OP Full - Fiction／ Sumika") on YouTube.

The original anime was called Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii which translates to "Love is hard for Otaku".  It's a very fun adult romance anime and is currently available on Amazon Prime Video.
