In setting up aggressivelyparaphrasing.me, I really struggled with how to manage domains.

Roughly, there are three main types of DNS records:

1. A/AAAA Records: These map a domain name to an IP Address.  A Records map to IPv4 addresses while AAAA records map to IPv6 addresses.
2. CNAME/ALIAS: These map one domain name to another.  CNAME responds to all DNS queries.  ALIAS responds to only those configured.  This means an ALIAS can co-exist with other types of records on the same name.  Moreover, ALIAS is resolved on the DNS server side, whereas CNAME is resolved client side.
3. URL Redirects: This seem like it's not at hte DNS level but at the HTTP level?
4. MX/MXE Records: These are for mail resolution, where MX points to a hostname and MXE points to an IP address.

Since NearlyFreeSpeech.net only provides a domain name, I must set up my CNAME/ALIAS for my website to point to their domain.
