Today I got to try a new item at the rotating City Streats stall and my first time at the Smoking Pig in the SAP Center.  Here are my thoughts.

## City Streats - Park Avenue Peppered Crispy Chicken

Would recommend.

City Streats is a rotating selection of food.  I’m guessing they’re somehow related to restaurants that are in the San Jose city area but it’s hard to tell.  Park Avenue is a real street.

Anyways, the food itself is breaded and fried crispy chicken bits with a pile of rice and a sauce drizzled on top.

It’s delicious.  The chicken is crispy, salted and peppered, and hearty.  The rice is not just plain rice; it definitely contains green onion and probably cilantro.  I guess it might be Mexican lime and cilantro rice.  One hint is the style it is cooked as: the rice is separated like Mexican lime cilantro rice where the oil or lard keeps the grains apart and slightly slippery.  However, it has a slight sweetness I can’t pinpoint.  The dish has an interesting sauce drizzled on top, something of a mix between Thai peanut sauce and Thai sweet chilling sauce.

This was about $12 and I think it’s pretty good value for the SAP center.

## Smoking Pig’s Burnt Ends Combo with Mac and Cheese

Smoking Pig is a restaurant established in San Jose that expanded into Fremont a few years ago and now has a third location in the SAP Center arena.

I ordered the Burnt Ends Combo.  The combo means it comes with a side and so is about $4 more, at $21 instead of $17.  Burnt Ends are brisket ends that are chopped up into one inch cubes and twice smoked so they’re extra crispy.  Mac and cheese is Mac and cheese.

I didn’t like it.  I found the whole thing a disappointment at many levels.  This was the most expensive item on the menu, but not by a lot.  It looks like you can basically only order sandwiches at this location.  Other choices are cheaper at $14 but it’s still pretty expensive for such a small sandwich that is mostly comprised of bread.  The bread isn’t particularly interesting.  It looked lightly toasted with maybe some mayonnaise but I think that just made the whole dish too heavy.   The burnt ends where pretty burnt feeling and I didn’t like that.  There was supposed to be a double glaze and I could kind of sense it, but I was overwhelmed by the breadiness of the bread and the burntness of the burnt ends.

What annoyed me the most was the serving and form-factor: both the Mac and cheese container and the sandwich wrapper were slick with grease.  Receiving and holding both items was an uncomfortable process until I could grab some napkins to quarantine the wrapper and container grease.  This is stadium food.  If I were at the sit-down restaurant, I would not mind because we’d have a roll of paper towels, a bib, perhaps some latex gloves like you would fine at a crawfish boil.  Instead, we’re sitting in cramped stadium chairs eating these greasy containers off our laps using our hands.  The napkins we get tear if we wipe our face a little too hard.

Maybe it’s not for me.  My brother liked it more than the City Streats and I loved those.
