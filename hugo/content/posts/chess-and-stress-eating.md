## Stress Eating Is Biologically Natural

If stress increases the number of calories burned so aggressively, maybe stress eating is a natural counter to that?

## Should I Workout More?

I’ve been holding back because I don’t want to spend so much time working out and I don’t want to burn out my body, especially my knees.  However, if these grandmasters are working out every day like this, maybe I should reconsider?

## Prioritizing Time

They seem to spend an incredible amount of time maintaining their bodies.  Maybe I should adjust my schedule too.  Focus more on gym and dance, less on work.  More on social and skills.

When I think about my priorities, I have a few I need to worry about:

* physical health: my diet, gym, dance, walking in general
* mental health: Japanese, meditation, journaling, solo expeditions, new experiences
* social health: eating out, dance, drawing, Japanese, conventions and concerts, working with others
* skills: dancing, drawing, Japanese, music

But I feel like I spend my time, I see something more like the following, where I spend significantly less time on the topic the lower it is:

1. Work
2. Internet readings and watching
3. Commute
4. Eating
5. Gym
6. Japanese
7. Music
