This is a reply and a reflection of an article I stumbled across an article titled ["Why Women Volunteer for Tasks That Don’t Lead to Promotions"](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=10807).  To give credit, I found this while reading [a post on /r/ExperiencedDevs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/dagjzx/how_many_devs_here_are_women/f1t1d00/).

In this, I wanted to focus on a particular concept that I found very interesting: office housework.  Below is a quote lifted from the piece that helps define office housework.

> Here’s a work scenario many of us know too well: You are in a meeting and your manager brings up a project that needs to be assigned. It’s not particularly challenging work, but it’s time-consuming, unlikely to drive revenue, and probably won’t be recognized or included in your performance evaluation. As your manager describes the project and asks for a volunteer, you and your colleagues become silent and uneasy, everyone hoping that someone else will raise their hand. The wait becomes increasingly uncomfortable. Then, finally, someone speaks up: “Okay, I’ll do it.”

> Non-promotable tasks are those that benefit the organization but likely don’t contribute to someone’s performance evaluation and career advancement. These tasks include traditional office “housework,” such as organizing a holiday party, as well as a much wider set of tasks, such as filling in for a colleague, serving on a low-ranking committee, or taking on routine work that doesn’t require much skill or produce much impact.

## What housework means to me

When I read about office housework, I immediately recognized the work being alluded to.

In the past, I've been asked if I think the work is beneath me.  I didn't like that connotation and I actually think a lot of the work I do can be seen as "beneath me".  How can I say this when I say I don't think it?  I see it in how everyone reacts to the work.  When I talk about it to other managers, their eyes glaze over.  When I try to get other engineers to help out on the project, they avoid it like a plague.  I've asked people to cover me for vacation on the project and everyone directly says "fuck no".  People don't volunteer for my project.

I don't think it's just me, if you're thinking that because I thought it at one point.  Maybe I was not giving the project enough love and care to make it blossom.  Even when it was my full time passion, people didn't care.  People don't even have armchair curiosity to inquire more because they have internalized the idea that if they know anything about this project, they'll be responsible for it, and no one wants that.  I thought maybe I was aggressive, abrasive, or just difficult to work with so people didn't want to work with me on this project.  I was worried that I was externalzing my problems, saying it's the project and not my personality.  However, I don't have this issue with other projects.  People actively try and reach out on my more technically interesting projects.  People attend my talks and ask questions.  They drop by to learn more and ask for links to documentation.  Doesn't that suggest it's the project and not me?

So why is this project so bad?  The HBS article summarizes it really well: lots of time, not challenging, the value is questionable.  What this leads to is a huge loss with very little benefit because the work is not rewarding in itself and will not be rewarded in monetary compensation as a promotion, bonus, or raise.

Thinking about it, my best projects were the opposite.  I remember one during my best early year at my first company.  It was a 4 week effort, so while it wasn't cheap on time, it was bounded.  The technical challenges were there.  It was cross functional so the social challenges were there.  And in the end, it was putting out a huge fire that my manager repeatedly emphasized will be compensated for.  We worked late nights into the weekends for this month of hell.  In the end, I got the best performance review I've ever received monetarily.  I got amazing peer feedback that year.  I got a lot of respect from a lot of teams and I learned a lot during the time.  I was a young naive junior engineer and I grew very fast in that month.  It wasn't perfect, and I fumbled a lot but my management guided me through those issues and I learned.  That is to say, not all toil is terrible.  Toil that is bounded with goals and clear reward structure is nice.  Some people value the graveyard shift and overtime because there's a clear reward structure.  You know what you're getting out of it.

Office house work is the exact opposite.  You might know you're getting nothing, but probably people are gonna convince you to do the work because of some weird side effect like teamwork or people will respect you.  I've heard someone say it'll be good on your performance review, but it's never talked about in terms of career growth.
