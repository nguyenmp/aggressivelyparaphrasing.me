I think about food a lot, to the point where I often read Wikipedia about various food topics.  Although it helps with trivia, I think the personal motivating factor is just curiosity.

Often times, I find suprising results that challenge the way I think about categories and cultural boundaries.  I haven't lived long enough to experience the divide of North and South Korea, or the colonialism and imperialism of the British empire, or the massive expansion and contraction of the Japanese empire.  What I do see is nationalism versus the global economy.  A battle of food fusion and cultural identity.  What suprised me the most is some iconic cultural foods have more complicated history.

I wanted to share some of the discoveries I've expereinced so far.

## Portuguese Tempura

The titular case: portuguese tempura.  Did you know tempura is originally portuguese?  I found this out because my Japanese teacher said it once and I didn't really understand at first.  However, after I investigated it further, I found out that tempura is traditionally made with battered and fried green-beans in Portugal.  I found this particularly interesting because I remember ordering tempura green-beans from The Habit burger and grill in Santa Barbara, thinking this was some new innovative mashup of Japanese cuisine and vegetables: an alternative to fries.  Little did I know, it was more traditional than the tempura I've learned to love.

## English Paprika

Did you know that in the English language, Paprika refers to a powdered pepper, whereas other languages define it as the pepper plant and the fruits it bears?

I discovered this when watching a TV show on Netflix.  I cna't remember which specifically I was watching but it was something like Sniffer, Shooter, or Blacklist.  It was an action intrigue series where some people tried to murder each other.  What I do remember is someone cutting peppers in a kitchen while the Audio Description reads out "paprika".  At that point, I was suprised because I expect paprika to be a powder.  Further research showed what I stated above, and I would have never know if I hadn't listened to the audio descriptions in Spanish.

## Lebansese Al-Pastor

Did you know al-pastor is originally lebanese?  I first heard abou this watching an early episode of Ugly Delicious where they talk about southern food.  I think they were interviewing some food critic from some famous news paper and they were talking about how he's tried so much mexican food and he still hasn't found it all yet.

## French Banh Mi

Have you ever noticed that the vietanmese Banh Mi is uses a french baguette, french butter, and pate?

I think I first really noticed it when my mom started cooking frog legs in french butter, and she was saying how french butter was just better.  At first, I thought, "wow, my mom sure is getting into french cooking."  But after a few months, I have come to accept that her half-vietnamese heritage probably shapes a lot of those opinions and exposures.

There's a lot of Vietnamese cuisine that I would consider traditional, but really comes from the occupation by the French, and later the rise of french cuisine as highly refined.  If you look at Vietnamese bakeries, they're a mashup of Vietnamese ingredients like durian, and french styles like the choux pastry: the bánh su kem (which isn't even defined on wikipedia).  It's noticibly different in construction compared to a traditional french profiterole or cream puff, or even other asian variants like Japan's [Beard Papa's](https://beardpapas.com) which is famous in it's own right.

## Chinese Ramen

Ever notice how the words "la mian" sounds oddly similar to "ramen", when they both represent some form of noodles in their respective countries?  It's probably related to the fact that man Japanese words are derived from Chinese words, as well as their overall cultural origins of coming from China to settle in Japan.

This is one where, while I can appreciate the linguistic similarities, I'm also fascinated by the cultural similarities.  "la mian" or "lai mien" as I like to pronounce it basically means "pulled noodles" and that's how those noodles are made.  A giant dough that is pulled and pulled until it becomes a really long and thin noodle wrapped around a bunch of times.  You can watch [the Tasty video that shows Chinese and Japanese noodle making](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2kesmAO8VU "The Art Of Making Noodles By Hand | Tasty").  I think it's particularly interesting because these two are about as authentic as you can get.  Both can be used in soups or stir-fried.  Both are wheat based, though other noodles use other flours as well like rice or buckwheat.

## Chinese Ketchup

It's not exactly "proven" but ketchup might have some origins, at least etymologically, from China!  This was brought to my attention watching [Chef John's Chinese BBQ Pork (Char Siu) recipe on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT7dUC-8PR0 "Chinese Barbecue Pork (Char Siu) Recipe - How to Make Chinese-Style BBQ Pork").

I always thought it was interesting watching my mom cook with Ketchup.  I think in her mind, it's just sweet tomato sauce, which isn't wrong.  For example, she'll glaze chicken with it before frying it, which creates a particularly nice sweet and acidic crispy caramel all around.  She'll make some strange spaghetti dish, similar to buttered noodles, but replace butter with ketchup.  It's delicious.  I don't know if it's authentic because I've never been to China but if my mom does it, that probably means something.

It's also really interesting watching Japan cook with ketchup.  Their omurice aka rice omlette makes heavy use of ketchup.  I particularly enjoyed the Youtube video by [Cooking with Dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTf5EgVY5uU "How to Make Omurice (Omelette Fried Rice Recipe) | Cooking with Dog").

## Japanese Mayonaise

Mayonaise is such a big thing in Japanese cuisine.  Look at most things that are fried like okonomiyaki, takoyaki, or yakisoba and you will probably find an unhealty amount of mayonaise on those dishes.

My introduction to Japanese cuisine started with instant ramen, teriyaki rice bowls, fried chicken karaage, and then sushi.  When I found mayonaise on sushi, I thought that it was such an American/western twist or tinge on the Japanese dish.  I thought that it must be pretty weird to accomodate the american taste pallette which is generally more savoury and fat focused.

When I tried Japanese food in Japan, I was suprised how heavily mayonaise is used in most fried foods.  They basically love it the way I've seen Americans love ranch dressing (which is also mayonaise).  Japan even has special brands of mayonaise that are a bit sweeter and thicker than what I would normally find in the US.  You can find [Kewpie mayonaise](https://www.kewpie.com) in most Japanese or Chinese supermarkets now and you can identify them by their iconic baby logo.

It's kind of amazing how I viewed this pretty original use of a foreign ingredient by a foreign country as unauthentic, when that use literally came from that country.

You can watch an example where [runnyrunny999 teaches how to cook okonomiyaki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZebItIYWJY "How to make Hiroshima style Okonomiyaki 広島風お好み焼きみたいなやつ").  The relevant mayonaise bit is at [6 minutes and 41 seconds](https://youtu.be/9ZebItIYWJY?t=401).

I really enjoyed [the Thrillist article on this topic](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/what-is-kewpie-mayo-japanese-mayonnaise "Why You Should Be Obsessed With Japan's Kewpie Mayo") as well.
