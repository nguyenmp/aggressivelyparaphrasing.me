Delicious.  Would recommend.

At the SAP Center, there's some food carts that have a rotating menu.  The menu seems to change every few weeks or maybe every month.  In the past, they've had a chicken tenders and rice dish as well as a funnel cake burger.  So far, I've enjoyed every dish they've sold this year.

I'll first talk about my review of the food itself, then I'll talk a little about the experience of buying and eating.

## The Tostada

These tostadas are a fried-til-crispy tortilla loaded with a generous layer of refried beans, some chicken, then pico-de-gallo, shredded cheddar, and finally some sour cream.

This particular set came with two and I was quite happy with the portions.  Mine had a generous heaping of food on them, moreso than the display dish.  It was to the point where, upon receiving my plate, bits of food fell on the counter because of how stacked the tostadas were.

One of my tortillas was really crispy so it was easy to eat with a fork.  However, the other one had gotten soggy by the time I had it.  I think it was just me taking my team to eat the second portion.  I think the fork crispy metric is pretty personal to me because I eat most dishes with a fork.  However, it does hold for others that if my fork can old up the tortilla, it's probably crispy and firm enough for the hand.  If my fork can crunch the tortilla easily and cleanly, so can your teeth.  If anything, eating with your hands and mouth should be easier.  A fork and knife requires finesse and suffers from low surface area and strength since it's a plastic disposable.  Your hands and mouth are pretty generous in error and strength.

I think either the Pico or the dish in general had a bit of jelape√±o on it because there was a bit of bitter smoky spice to the dish.  I like this touch but spicy isn't for everyone.

## The Experience

Ordering at these food carts is a bit weird.  You tell the cook and the cashier separately that you want to order.  They don't talk to each other for the most part.  The process is a bit confusing and unguided so I definitely messed things up, probably.

What I think is supposed to happen is you walk to the cook, ask for an order, and then walk to the register and pay for your food.  While you wait for the transaction to finish, your food is prep'd and served to you next to the register so there's a bit of concurrency and pipelining.

What I ended up doing was I watched the cook make a dish, I decided I wanted one, and I walked to the register to pay.  I stood around for a few seconds and they asked if I had told the chef yet because the chef was just standing around.  I then went to tell the chef who started cooking.  I stood around there.  When they finished, they awkwardly looked at me and I realized they had no easy way of handing me my dish except to pass it to the register side so I walked back to the register.  I'll probably remember this forever.  It seemed so uncomfortable for everyone involved.

On the bright side, as I walked away, at least 4 people stopped to ask where I got my food because it looked delicious!  I love when my food looks delicious, and this one tastes that way too.
