I was reading a post on ExperiencedDevs asking about women in engineering when I stumbled across [an article](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=10807) talking about how women are more likely to volunteer for office housework.

## What housework means to me

When I read about office housework, I immediately recognized the work being alluded to.

In the past, I've been asked if I think the work is beneath me.  I didn't like that connotation and I actually think a lot of the work I do can be seen as "beneath me".  How can I say this when I say I don't think it?  I see it in how everyone reacts to the work.  When I talk about it to other managers, their eyes glaze over.  When I try to get other engineers to help out on the project, they avoid it like a plague.  I've asked people to cover me for vacation on the project and everyone directly says "fuck no".  People don't volunteer for my project.

I don't think it's just me, if you're thinking that because I thought it at one point.  Maybe I was not giving the project enough love and care to make it blossom.  Even when it was my full time passion, people didn't care.  People don't even have armchair curiosity to inquire more because they have internalized the idea that if they know anything about this project, they'll be responsible for it, and no one wants that.  I thought maybe I was aggressive, abrasive, or just difficult to work with so people didn't want to work with me on this project.  I was worried that I was externalzing my problems, saying it's the project and not my personality.  However, I don't have this issue with other projects.  People actively try and reach out on my more technically interesting projects.  People attend my talks and ask questions.  They drop by to learn more and ask for links to documentation.  Doesn't that suggest it's the project and not me?

So why is this project so bad?  The HBS article summarizes it really well: lots of time, not challenging, the value is questionable.  What this leads to is a huge loss with very little benefit because the work is not rewarding in itself and will not be rewarded in monetary compensation as a promotion, bonus, or raise.

Thinking about it, my best projects were the opposite.  I remember one during my best early year at my first company.  It was a 4 week effort, so while it wasn't cheap on time, it was bounded.  The technical challenges were there.  It was cross functional so the social challenges were there.  And in the end, it was putting out a huge fire that my manager repeatedly emphasized will be compensated for.  We worked late nights into the weekends for this month of hell.  In the end, I got the best performance review I've ever received monetarily.  I got amazing peer feedback that year.  I got a lot of respect from a lot of teams and I learned a lot during the time.  I was a young naive junior engineer and I grew very fast in that month.  It wasn't perfect, and I fumbled a lot but my management guided me through those issues and I learned.  That is to say, not all toil is terrible.  Toil that is bounded with goals and clear reward structure is nice.  Some people value the graveyard shift and overtime because there's a clear reward structure.  You know what you're getting out of it.

Office house work is the exact opposite.  You might know you're getting nothing, but probably people are gonna convince you to do the work because of some weird side effect like teamwork or people will respect you.  I've heard someone say it'll be good on your performance review, but it's never talked about in terms of career growth.
