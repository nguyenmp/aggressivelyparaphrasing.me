The [New York Times' Silicon Valley Youth Problem](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/magazine/silicon-valleys-youth-problem.html) recently came up on my Facebook news feed.  While it was a bit jumpy and cobbled together, I really connected with it at various levels and I wanted to share some of my personal highlights and further interpretation of the piece.

## The Glamorless B2B Industry

The piece introduces Cisco and Meraki, both of which are relatively unknown to the general population but form the backbone for the incredible Internet based industries.  This reminds me of the types of stocks that my friends used to trade: the business-to-business (B2B) kind that gets relatively low press coverage, published the same financial information as most other companies, and have a significant amount of cash flow.

If you really think about it, companies are MUCH more likely to pay for their tools and products because their perspective on value is pretty utilitarian.  Personal and individual consumers have a much more nuanced and psychological perspective on value.  Monthly subscriptions, pirvacy, and fads are all examples of the weirdness of how B2C businesses have to operate.  It's much easier to legalize against another company that has money rather than an individual for not paying their $10/month.

Many of the most successful tech companies market themselves as both sides of the market.  Amazon sells consumer products but also their infrastructure and support to other businesses.  Microsoft and Google do the same for their infrastructure.  Even companies like Costco have most of their name as a consumer provider but most of their business comes from their wholesale market, directly shipping to businesses in bulk since that makes the most sense.

## Timely Yet Classic

The first thing that jumped out at me was this was published by an engineering intern around the time I was graduating from university.
