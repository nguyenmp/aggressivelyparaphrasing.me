> Managers can't read minds.

That is a quote from Camille Fournier's The Managers Path.  It's also a phrase used by some of the managers I work with and I think it's profoundly stupid and profoundly effective.  I want to talk about why I like this phrase so much and the small detail I don't like about it.

## Attachment Theory

Here's my generalization of attachment theory: "Secure" people do well in relationships; "Insecure" people don't do well due to a myriad of reasons.  Just over half of people are secure.  Just under half are insecure.  The twist is that good relationships can foster as long as one of the two are secure.  Bad relationships foster when both are insecure.

The reason I mention all of this attachment theory mumbo-jumbo is that I strongly apply these ideas to management concepts.  I really feel that a good working relationship sprouts when at least one participant operates in a secure mentality.  One person can help carry the relationship, So to speak.  I see this exhibited as open communication, active encouragement, empowerment, actively depending on one another through delegation and support.

I also believe that toxic and unproductive work relationships foster when both parties act in insecure manners.  There's a lot of insecure subtypes but I think they're all iconic.  They could manifest as avoiding communication, having a hero-complex, condescension, defensiveness, excessive attachment to the product, hermitting themselves, overall fear and avoidance, lack of participation.  I have seen all of these, and I've done many of these to some extent.

I think what I want to show here is a framework of thinking about work relationships through the lense of attachment theory.

One silver lining in this framework is that you just need one secure mentality to stabilize a relationship.  The second is that attachment theory isn't fate.  I credit the idea that attachment theory isn't fate to my close friend who shook me out of my escapism when I tried to use this framework to justify the actions I took.  It's just a way of thinking about the problem.  What I got out of this is that I could intentionally change the way I act and help catalyze a good relationship.  I could share this idea with others and we can support one another in fostering safe environments for people to feel secure.
