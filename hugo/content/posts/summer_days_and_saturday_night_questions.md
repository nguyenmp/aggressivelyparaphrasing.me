I was listening to the Global Top 100 songs by Spotify today to keep in touch with popular culture and the youth these days while I was working out at the gym.  The song [Summer Days by Martin Garrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdvvPtIfR8w "Martin Garrix feat. Macklemore & Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy - Summer Days [Lyric Video]") came up and at around 76 seconds in (or 1:16 timestamp), the guitar rift that came up reminded me so strongly of the intro song to Recovery of an MMO Junkie, [Saturday Night Question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ln6NpxYb73k "Recovery of an MMO Junkie - Opening | Saturday Night Question").

By the way, if you haven't watched that anime yet, it's pretty decent.  Yet another adult romance anime.  Available on [CrunchyRoll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/recovery-of-an-mmo-junkie "Recovery of an MMO Junkie on CrunchyRoll")!
