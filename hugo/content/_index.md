This is my personal website.  There are two types of content:

<dl>
<dt>Wikis</dt>
<dd>These are living documents that get updated over time.  I use them to develop my thoughts and use as references.  Generally, they're just dumps of information.</dd>
<dt>Notes</dt>
<dd>These are the "blog" of my website.  You'll find a list of popular tags I've used when posting.</dd>
