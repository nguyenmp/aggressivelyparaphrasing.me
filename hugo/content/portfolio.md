## Projects

**Aggressively Paraphrasing Me**: That's this website!  Check out the home page for an overview, and the README.md for technical details.

**Doppelgänger**: Used machine learning to identify colleagues who look the most and the least similar to you.  You, too, can find your twin!

**Hikari Ita**: Created a flashcarding webapp to help me study Japanese and Mandarin on the go!  Based on spaced repetition, it allows you to quiz based on pronunciation, character recognition, as well as meaning.

**Tarball Analyzer in Rust**:  Implemented a tarball decompressor and analyzer in Rust.  The goal was to see how much individual files in the archive contributed to the total compressed size of the result.  The implementation was based on the [tar](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Standard.html "Basic Tar Format") and [gzip](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1952 "GZIP file format specification version 4.3") spec.

**CSIL Status**:  Created a system to monitor the university workstations to track which were available and running the least amount of work.  Additionally, allowed friends to notify when they arrived at a workstation to facilitate collaboration and communication.  Built an android and web frontend.
