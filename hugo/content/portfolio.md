**Aggressively Paraphrasing Me**: That's this website!  Check out the home page for more details.

**DoppelgaÌˆnger**: Used machine learning to identify coworkers who look the most and the least like you.

**Hikari Ita**: Created a flashcarding app to help me study Japanese and Mandarin on the go!  Based on spaced repetition, it allows you to quiz based on pronunciation, character recognition, as well as meaning.  By utilizing a groundbreaking new design for flashcards, I've disrupted the hobbist language-learning industry.
